His Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents are separating parents from their children, deporting innocent people and spreading fear in immigrant communities across the country. The budget he just released slashes funding for the social safety net in order to spend billions of dollars building his wall, increasing his deportation force and expediting deportations.</p> <p><strong>Senate Democrats have the power to block funding for Trump&#8217;s wall and his massive deportation force. Recent reports show they may be willing to fight to stop Trump&#8217;s hateful agenda.</strong><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"> </span><strong>Can you help make sure they stand strong?</strong></p> <p>We cannot let any Senate Democrat cave to political pressure from the right-wing and give Republicans the 60 votes they need to fund Trump’s hate. That is where progressives come in. We have to show Democratic senators that <strong>we will have their backs if they act boldly and that we will hold them accountable if they fail to stand up for immigrants.</strong></p> <p><strong>Tell Senate Democrats: Block funding for Trump’s attacks on immigrants. Click here to sign the petition.</strong></p> <p>Trump wants to harass, deport and reject people who have come or are dreaming of coming to the United States seeking refuge from conflict, lives free from persecution and better economic opportunities for their families. For as long as Trump is president and extremist right-wing Republicans are willing to enable his agenda, Senate Democrats will have a choice: enable Trump’s agenda of criminalization and deportations, or resist and obstruct his racist regime at every turn. <strong>It is up to make sure they do the right thing.</strong></p> <p><strong>Tell Senate Democrats: Block funding for Trump’s attacks on immigrants.</strong></p> ',
